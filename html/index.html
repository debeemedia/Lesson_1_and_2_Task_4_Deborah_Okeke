                The SDG of Zero Hunger can be summarised as: end hunger, achieve
                food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable
                agriculture. Sustainable Food Security remains one of the
                biggest challenges in Nigeria and majority of these challenges
                can be attributed to Nigeria&#39;s rising population, increasing
                drought and poor irrigation, increasing soil erosion, climate
                change, food spoilage and wastage, and more. For instance,
                regarding wastage, some sources say that
                <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/218417-55-per-cent-nigerias-fruits-vegetables-perish-consumption.html?tztc=1" title="The Agricultural Fresh Produce Growers and Exporters Association of Nigeria (AFPGEAN) says between 55 per cent and 72 per cent of fresh produce grown in the country perish before they can be consumed." target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 55 per cent of perishable crops perish before making it to the market and end-user.</a>

                <h2>How Do We Tackle This Problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Establishing
                        <a name="processing-factories"> processing factories</a>
                        seems to be the obvious answer to curtailing food
                        spoilage, second to setting up storage
                        facilities.
                    </strong>
                    In the case of storage facilities, dependence on electricity
                    supply is a major constraint in a country like Nigeria. This
                    indeed brings up yet another challenge of achieving
                    <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7" title="SDG 7 Target: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                        Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7)
                    </a>
                    , which can only be solved by new and innovative ways of
                    generating power, e.g., solar. One strategy that can be
                    adopted is the setting up of solar generating plants (by the
                    government or private companies) to power cold rooms.
                    Farmers can then store their perishable crops in these cold
                    rooms for a very subsidized fee, a price they will be
                    willing to forego in place of the ultimate wastage or
                    marginal selling losses that will ensue. For the option of
                    setting up processing plants, some strides have been taken
                    by some private companies. Unfortunately, failure has been
                    the case for the most part. The example that readily comes
                    to mind is
                    <a href="https://businesspost.ng/economy/dangotes-tomato-plant-shuts-down-again-after-five-months/" title="Dangote’s Tomato Plant Shuts Down Again After Five Months." target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                        Aliko Dangote’s multi billion naira processing factory
                        in Kano
                    </a>
                    that was set up to process raw tomatoes into paste. All
                    tomato farmers within the vicinity were employed in
                    producing tomatoes that would feed the processing plant, but
                    unfortunately, supply was not enough! The major reason why
                    the bright and shiny mega tonne-capacity plant had to close
                    down. A lesson that can be learnt here is the need for a
                    stable, consistent and guaranteed supply of “quality” raw
                    tomatoes. This brings me to the next proffered solution,
                    greenhouse farming.

                <p> <strong>2. Adoption of <a name="greenhouse-tech">greenhouse</a> farming techniques.</strong> This not only solves the problem of all-year-round production of high-value vegetable crops, it also mitigates climate and environmental challenges— this mitigation being the means by which all-year-round production is made possible in the first place. The embodiment of greenhouses, to some extent, takes care of irrigation and soil erosion problems listed earlier. That being said, the quality, apart from variety, of tomatoes from greenhouses contributes greatly to their longer shelf life. Greenhouse farming is a budding area in the agriculture sector of Nigeria, which is a shame, seeing the giant strides being made by counterpart like Kenya. I have a personal interest in this field and I encourage fellow youths to begin to look at innovative techniques like this, to solve food security challenges in
                our nation.
